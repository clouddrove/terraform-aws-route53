We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)






## Examples

**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-sqs/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### FIFO Queue
```hcl
  module "sqs" {
    source                      = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-sqs.git"
    name                        = "sqs-fifo"
    application                 = "clouddrove"
    environment                 = "test"
    label_order                 = ["environment", "name", "application"]
    fifo_queue                  = true
    content_based_deduplication = true
  }
```
### Standard Queue
```hcl
  module "sqs" {
    source                    = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-sqs.git"
    name                      = "sqs"
    application               = "clouddrove"
    environment               = "test"
    label_order               = ["environment", "name", "application"]
    delay_seconds             = 90
    max_message_size          = 2048
    message_retention_seconds = 86400
    receive_wait_time_seconds = 10
    policy                    = data.aws_iam_policy_document.document.json
  }

  data "aws_iam_policy_document" "document" {
    version = "2012-10-17"
    statement {
      sid    = "First"
      effect = "Allow"
      principals {
        type        = "AWS"
        identifiers = ["*"]
      }
      actions   = ["sqs:SendMessage"]
      resources = ["arn:aws:sqs:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxx:test-sqs-clouddrove"]
    }
  }
```



## Inputs

|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| application | Application (e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`). | string | `` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | list | `<list>` | no |
| content_based_deduplication | Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO queues. | bool | `false` | no |
| create | Whether to create SQS queue. | bool | `true` | no |
| delay_seconds | The time in seconds that the delivery of all messages in the queue will be delayed. An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). | number | `0` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | string | `-` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | string | `` | no |
| fifo_queue | Boolean designating a FIFO queue. | bool | `false` | no |
| kms_data_key_reuse_period_seconds | The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). | number | `300` | no |
| kms_master_key_id | The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. | string | `` | no |
| label_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | list | `<list>` | no |
| max_message_size | The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. An integer from 1024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262144 bytes (256 KiB). | number | `262144` | no |
| message_retention_seconds | The number of seconds Amazon SQS retains a message. Integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1209600 (14 days). | number | `345600` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | string | `` | no |
| policy | The JSON policy for the SQS queue. | string | `` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the SQS queue. |
| id | The URL for the created Amazon SQS queue. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |



## Testing

In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
